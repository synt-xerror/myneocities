	<p>Hello fella, a lot of changes.</p>
    
	<p>I stole smth about 2 or 3 hundred neocities websites to upgrade my own.</p>
	<p>This is the new homepage. Do you like it? If you answered this, you're kinda weird, you're speaking to text a screen.</p>
	<p>Speaking about screens, this website will TRY to be responsible. So, it will no more broke on phones, expect you, that is too broke to buy at least a laptop to browse internet.</p>
	<p>If you don't get it, it's a joke. Please, press this button to laugh out a lot: <button onclick="laugh.play();">lol</button></p>

	<hr>

	<p>Well, while I don't finish this crap, you can see my other (boring) projects that I'm currently working on too, like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/synt-xerror/neocities-c">Neocities C :</a>
		    C library to work with Neocities API. Not useful tho, you can just use neocities cli or node.js library.
		</li>

		<li><a href="https://github.com/synt-xerror/backupcraft">BackupCraft: </a>
		    Tool for backup your minecraft java world. Useless too, is writed in Bash, works only on linux and it's easily replaceable by a rsync, borg, pika, vorta or whataver cool backup software.
		</li>

		<li>
		    <a href="https://github.com/synt-xerror/reddust">RedDust: </a>
		    That's my coolest project. It's a programming language inspired by assembly languages, made to be very very simple language, with only 16  one character commands, that go from 0 to F (15 in hexadecimal).
		    Will be a handbook to you create your own RedDust compiler or interpreter for your projects, like a mini CPU, or a computer made with redstone on Minecraft (RedDust was created this way).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Any projects i listed are really done, I'm working every day to improve it.</p>

	<p>I really like to create, i love programming and computer science, but i'm not good creating usefull stuffs, so i work for hobbie and self-learning.</p>
