	<p>Hello fella, a lot of changes.</p>
    
	<p>I stole smth about 2 or 3 hundred neocities websites to upgrade my own.</p>
	<p>This is the new homepage. Do you like it? If you answered this, you're kinda weird, you're speaking to text a screen.</p>
	<p>Speaking about screens, this website will TRY to be responsible. So, it will no more broke on phones, expect you, that is too broke to buy at least a laptop to browse internet.</p>
	<p>If you don't get it, it's a joke. Please, press this button to laugh out a lot: <button exec="laugh.play();">lol</button></p>

	<p>Well, while I don't finish this crap, you can see my other (boring) projects that I'm currently working on too, like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/synt-xerror/neocities-c"><strong>Neocities C :</strong></a>
		    C library to work with Neocities API. Not useful tho, you can just use neocities cli or node.js library.
		</li>

		<li><a href="https://github.com/synt-xerror/backupcraft"><strong>BackupCraft: </strong></a>
		    Tool for backup your minecraft java world. Useless too, is writed in Bash, works only on linux and it's easily replaceable by a rsync, borg, pika, vorta or whataver cool backup software.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I really like to create, i love programming and computer science, but i'm not good creating usefull stuffs, so i work for hobbie and for my self-learning.</p>
