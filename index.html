	<h3>Welcome, traveler.</h3>

	<p>
	    This website <strong>NEVER</strong> dies, just take long brakes.
	</p>

	<p>
	    I'm trying to make it useful for Linux users, developers, technnology enthusiasts or whatever type of nerd you are.
	    You'll find cool stuffs, like tips, news, tools and more about this beautiful world of technnology.
	</p>

	<p>
	    This website was created to be lightweight, fast and useful. I believe so much on the KISS philosophy of projects like Linux, Git, C, Lua and more.
	    So don't expect cool lights, sounds, effects and the HTML party that other Neocities websites make. At most a simple script or a basic CSS style, but not more than this.
	    You can find the source code on GitHub, so you can make sure that I'm not hacking you or something.
	    It's so light and simple that you can access it from your terminal emulator or TTY, using a TUI browser like Chawan, and of course, smartphones. I don't know why, but most
	    of the Neocities websites and personal websites in general doesn't like to be responsible on differents sizes of screens, they're acting like: "haha look how look I am,
	    I lost users every day just because they doesn't have a really fuckinh big screen, I'm sooo cool and y2k B)". If you think like that, sybau. Phone users are welcome too.
	</p>

	    Thank you for read, you're very special, I didn't expect anyone to read this. Now you're very welcome to surf on my website :)
