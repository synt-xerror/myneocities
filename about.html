<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hey.</p>
	<img src="./assets/SyntaxError-Logo.png" style="width: 200px">
	<p>
	    That's me, btw, I'm a pixel art computer with a red screen, truth.
	</p>
	<p>
	    I'm a software developer and IT support. I really love computer science, operating systems, open-source and all that's related to computers and low-level code.
	</p>
	<p>
	    I'm from Brazil, state of São Paulo, so of course my native language isn't English, but Portuguese. That's why my English sounds like a Latino trying to speak English, which is my exactly situation.
	    But, improving every day.
	</p>
	<p>
	    I enjoy MLP - and yes, you can call me a Brony for that. The show is for kids and little girls, without a doubt. I liked it because I think the writing is funny and well-made, the history
	    is interesting - yeah, this pony show has extensive lore that can be compared with Adventure Time, Owl House and even FNAF, haha! I talk more about it on my blog, some day.

<h1>Website Information</h1>
	<p>
	    I work on a ThinkPad E470 with CachyOS XFCE. I'm using it mainly because it's good for games, but I'm going to try Gentoo soon. I made this website using HTML, CSS and JS, with Neovim and Vim (yes, two editors). 
	    The project is hosted on Neocities (what a big surprise, huh?). The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/synt-xerror/myneocities">GitHub</a> and <a href="source.html">/source</a>. It will be
	    on SourceForge soon.
	</p>
	<p>
	    This page was created to be lightweight, fast and useful. I strongly believe in the KISS philosophy of projects like Linux, Git, C, Lua and more.
	    So don't expect 'cool' lights, sounds and effects. At most, expect a simple script or a basic CSS style, but not more than this.
	    You can find the source code on GitHub, so you can make sure that I'm not hacking you or something.
	</p>
	<p>
	    It's so light and simple that you can access it from your terminal emulator or TTY, using a TUI browser like Chawan, and of course, smartphones - this site
	    has the responsible certificate, all screen sizes will work wonderfully.
