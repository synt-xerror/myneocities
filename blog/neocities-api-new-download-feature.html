		If you are developing websites on Neocities, you probably already know about the API, that lets you upload, delete files, get
		information about your website, and other things, that's very good to make automations like a script that publish a post to
		your blog.
	    </p>
	    <p class="blog-p">
		You can do so much things with just this api, but one thing that we can't right now is a very useful one, this feature
		is a Download option, that is missing. Developers on Neocities pray for a day that this feature will come to the API, 
		and we'll can finally download the files from our pages with only a terminal and some lines of code (or commands if you
		like to use the CLI).
	    </p>
	    <p class="blog-p">
		Well, I send an email to the Neocities team suggesting this feature, that would be very very useful. And guys... that was the
		response:

	    <p class="quote">
		"Apologies for the delay in response. The best way to do this with the API right now is to get a list of the files on the site
		and to do download each file sequentially. But I agree that it's a good idea to have a download feature too and it should be
		implemented. I'll add it to our features TODO list. Thanks!"

	    <p class="blog-p">
		Our dream is finally getting true! We're going to download our website using a terminal emulator!!
	    </p>
	    <p class="blog-p">
		Imagine all the things we're gonna do with this! Automatic backups, static CI/CD, snapshots (without git), and whataver your
		creativity can imagine. That will be so nice to me, because I'm developing a tool to neocities developers, named "Neogities",
		that will be a versioning tool like Git, but will have a bit more of tools to make your website development very very cool.
